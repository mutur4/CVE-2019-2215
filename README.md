### Bad-Binder (CVE-2019-2215)
The following is the exploit for the **bad binder** *(CVE-2019-2215)* vulnz that was tested on a x86 Emulator. The aim was to abuse the UAF vulnerability to trigger an AAR primitive to leak kernel addresses and use an AAW primitive to overwrite `addr_limit` leading to a Kernel Read and Write primitive allowing us to modify the `cred_struct` for Local-Priviledge-Escalation `(LPE)`.
